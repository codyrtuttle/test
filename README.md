This is  my first time using Git, GitHub, or Sublime. I'm getting used to this and am not really sure what's going on, but I'm going to do my best to learn it. 
For example, I'm not sure at all how to save this or update the actual document in GitHub, which I'm currently trying to do using Sublime. 
Anybody actually reading this is really confused, I'm sure.
